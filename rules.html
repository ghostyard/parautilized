            <h2>Bureau Regulation Reminder</h2>
            <p><u>REMINDER!</u></p>
            <p>
                <accent>CONTENT WARNING</accent> this blog is not nearly as heavy as my other blogs. however, there's a lot
                of just straight up weird content on here. derealization, unreality, overlapping worlds. there will be
                some oblique references to traumatic events. i will tag for all of this as trigger tw, which translates as mental illness tw, drugs tw, etc.
                for my own general comfort, i <b>will not write with minors</b>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <accent>ACTIVITY</accent> this is a low activity blog. you can probably find me more often on <b>@grayboxed</b>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <accent>SHIPPING</accent> open to it, but let's talk. jesse is bisexual with a general preference towards women,
                and is also... busy. 
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <accent>WRITING & STYLE</accent> i don't use icons and i use normal sized
                text. i don't mind if other people use small text. double small text
                can be hard for me to read sometimes. also, although i generally write
                in third person, i like first person threads. jesse has an intrusive
                internal monologue that she directs at an entity known as polaris/hedron,
                and later out of habit.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <accent>ON CANON</accent> basically following canon. we don't know where
                control 2 is ending up, so i'm guessing and letting things get weird.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <accent>INTERACTIONS</accent> ask memes are a good way to kick things off.
                i will occasionally put out starter calls, and i may check if you're
                okay with the weirder parts of the remedyverse (a floppy disk with
                the nuclear codes that telekinetically launches objects. this is an
                evil little pun about launching things).
              </p>
              <p>
                <accent>NEED A SUMMARY?</accent> i love to talk about the remedyverse. i 
                fucking love control. you can come ask me questions at any point.
              </p>
              <p>
