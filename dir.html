                <trait>FIVE NEGATIVES</trait> stubborn, blunt, detached, regretful, indecisive.<br>
                <trait>RELIGION</trait> staunchly atheist. there’s no god. there are about a billion paranatural forces at work, though, that might kind of act like god.<br>
                <trait>DIAGNOSES</trait> ptsd, social anxiety, undiagnosed autism (she has not had access to regular medical care at all).<br>
                <trait>KNOWN LANGUAGES</trait> english, bits of spanish from skipping around the u.s. and working blue collar jobs.<br>
                <trait>SKILLS</trait> one of the objectively strongest parautilitarians ever encountered by the fbc, mainly rivaled by her brother and possibly alan wake. this doesn't actually manifest as much besides hunches and vague connections with the paranatural force known as <i>polaris</i> until she enters the oldest house. once she encounters objects of power, she displays an innate talent for binding objects of power to herself, which allows her to utilize paranatural abilities.<br>
                <trait>INTERESTS</trait> poetry, oddly enough. used to tinker with cars and bikes because of how often she traveled before, but hasn't had the opportunity to do that in a while.<br>

                <trait>PHYSICAL AILMENTS</trait> has gained quite a few scars since becoming director, and thus some of the aches and pains. <br>
                <trait>PIERCINGS/TATTOOS</trait> all from before her stint as director - a tattoo of a northern flicker along her right shoulder, a set of stars forming ursa minor along the right side of her ribcage, plenty of smaller ones from whenever she had the spare cash.<br>
                <trait>SCARS</trait> a lot. she has a scar along her browbone from binding the object of power colloquially called the floppy disk, and plenty of smaller scars from encounters with hiss-infected fbc members and other troublesome objects of power.<br>
                <trait>SPEECH/TONE</trait> monotone and quiet. jesse has a fairly flat affect at most things and an extremely high tolerance for weirdness. zones out a lot while speaking to polaris. she can have a surprising amount of authority when she needs to, but she doesn’t always display it.<br>
                <trait>BODY TYPE</trait> relatively healthy, slender. not overly strong, but has done a lot of physical labor in her time.<br>
                <trait>HAIR</trait> natural redhead, often messy and tied back in a ponytail. being director did not improve matters.<br>
                <trait>WARDROBE</trait> on her own volition, it’s a plain black t-shirt and a very dark navy leather jacket—almost blue, with some jeans and boots. she is very normally dressed. she will wear a suit for her job, but she doesn’t particularly like it. <br>

                <accent>1992</accent> Dylan Faden (P6) is born in Ordinary, Maine.</p>
                <accent>2002</accent> Jesse and Dylan Faden discover a slide projector in Ordinary's junkyard and activate it, opening a pathway to other worlds. The slide projector was eventually discovered by several other local children, who came into contact with another paranatural entity who influenced them towards violence. After Jesse and Dylan were interrogated by their parents about the slide projector, Jesse, using one of the slides, inadvertently wished away all of the adults in Ordinary.</p>

                <p>Left to their own devices, the local children eventually stole the slide projector back from those who had been affected by the slide. Jesse, with the help of the entity that she would call <b>Polaris</b>, stopped the slide projector and burned most of the slides. The Federal Bureau of Control then arrived to investigate the events in Ordinary, discovered the slide projector, and attempted to apprehend the Faden siblings. They successfully captured Dylan Faden, but Jesse escaped.</b></p>

              <p>
                <accent>2003-2009</accent> Jesse enters the foster system for most of her childhood, bouncing from foster home to foster home. She is occasionally guided by Polaris. In truth, the Federal Bureau of Control keeps tabs on her during this time, seeing her as an alternate candidate for the role of the Bureau's director if their experiment with Dylan Faden failed. roams across the United States, rarely staying in one place. 
              </p>

              <p>
                <accent>2009-2019</accent> As an adult, Jesse begins to roam around the United States, trying to avoid the Bureau's agents and attention. During this time, she ends up briefly committed to a psychiatric facility, where she is interviewed. These interviews are retrieved by the FBC for further data collection.
              </p>

              <p>
                <accent>2019</accent> Prompted by Polaris, Jesse arrives at the Oldest House in New York City in order to find her brother. In doing so, she becomes the director of the Federal Bureau of Control and begins to deal with the infestation of the paranatural resonance that she names the Hiss, attempting to remove it from the Oldest House. In her explorations of the House, she decides that neither the Hiss nor the Board can be trusted.
              </p>

              <p>
                <accent>2019-2024</accent> The Oldest House remains in lockdown. Jesse continues to attempt to remove the Hiss, even as the Astral Plane begins to leak into New York City and other locations via the doors in the Oldest House. The Hiss invasion itself has been stalled, but the infestation is ongoing.

              home safe. Weight measurements vary.</p>
            <p>When bound, the object allows
              parautilitarians to telekinetically gather
              items and debris from their surroundings.</p>
            </p>
            <p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>
            <p>Discovered in the basement of a home in <span>[REDACTED]</span>, Ohio, the
              object gained rapid interest in certain online forums dedicated to
              opening abandoned safes. After months of failure, the owner
              attempted to open it with explosives. The object survived with no
              physical damage. Bureau agents were dispatched, now confident
              of its paranatural nature.</p>
            <p>Blood occasionally emerges from seam around the object’s door.
              Tests confirm the blood is not human. X-rays taken of the object
              indicate that something is trapped inside, though the images are
              always blurred, which indicates the contents of the object are
              moving. All attempts to open the object have been unsuccessful.</p>

            <p><u>DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:</u></p>
            <p>The object is a lightbox used to examine
              x-ray images. The image cannot be
              removed from the lightbox. The
              information on the image belongs to a
              patient named <span>[REDACTED]</span>.</p>
            <p>The object allows parautilitarians to forcefully seize an individual’s
            <span>[REDACTED REDACTED]</span>. The seized individual becomes
            <span>[REDAED]</span> to the user. The effect lasts <span>[REDACTED]</span>. Once
              released, the seized <span>[REED]</span> as a result of the psychic trauma.</p>

            <p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>
            <p>A janitor named <span>[REED REDACTED]</span> bound the object at St.
              Anne’s Hospital in <span>[REDACTED]</span>. Soon, the building’s occupants
              were <span>[REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED]</span> by him.</p>
            <p>The Bureau dispatched an emergency response team to <span>[REDA

            <p>A CRT television built by Benicoff and
              Sons Electrics. The screen is still
              functional.</p>
            <p>The object can levitate itself off the ground to a maximum
              observed altitude of <span>[RED]</span>. When bound, the object allows
              parautilitarians to harness this effect for their own use (see report
            <span>[REDACTED]</span> for the results tested with Prime Candidate <span>[RED]</span>).</p>
            </p>
            <p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>
            <p>The object was first discovered in a local news story from
            <span>[REDACTED]</span>, Kansas. A figure had been seen <span>[REDADD]</span> over
              buildings. The Bureau dispatched agents to the town, who
              discovered that a man named <span>[REDACTED RED]</span> had bound
              himself to the object. Mr. <span>[REDACTED]</span> was detained (see case 39-
              HQ-656) and the object was brought to the Bureau for study.</p>
