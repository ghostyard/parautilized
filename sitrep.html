          <h2>Overview of the Hiss Threat: Part I</h2>
          <p align="center"><b>-- CONFIDENTIAL --</b></p>
          <p>Definitionally, the Hiss appears to be a self-propagating force of paranatural resonance. Originating from Slidescape-36, it is aggressive and contagious. The only known resistance is the Hedron entity and its associated HRA devices, as developed by Dr. Casper Darling. 

            It is unknown whether the Hiss is intelligent or simply an unthinking signal. It is most often associated with "the Hiss incantation", an abstract poem (see FBC33940-4) repeated by those who have been infected by the Hiss's signal.</p>
            <p>The Hiss's effects are clear and obvious. On some level, the signal can warp those it infects on a molecular level, causing their bodies to stretch, warp, and break, and almost always including the loss of hair. Members of the FBC infected by the Hiss range from those suspended in the air,
              seemingly repeating the Hiss incantation in order to propagate it further, to active agents of the Hiss driven to oppose the FBC and the Oldest House. In some ways, it may function colloquially as a paranatural "earworm" that then
              connects all those infected in a kind of hive mind, as all those infected by the Hiss in an area are often found chanting the incantation as one. You are a worm through time.  
            </p>
          <p>
            The Hiss's goal is entirely unclear. The thunder song distorts you. It corrupts all that it touches, including the Oldest House, Objects of Power, and the very nature of reality itself. It is of the utmost importance that the Hiss remain contained and then completely eradicated. Happiness comes. White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Leave your insides by the door. Push the fingers through the surface into the wet. You’ve always been the new you. You want this to be true. We stand around you while you dream. You can almost hear our words but you forget. This happens more and more now. You gave us the permission in your regulations. We wait in the stains. The word that describes this is redacted. Repeat the word. The name of the sound. It resonates in your house. After the song, time for applause. We build you till nothing remains. The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. You are home. You remind us of home. You’ve taken your boss with your boss with you. All hair must be eaten. Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away. After the song, time for applause. This cliché is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! How do you say “insane”? Hurts to be happy. An earworm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream: "Baby baby baby, yeah." Just plastic. So safe and nothing to worry about. Ha ha, funny. The last egg breaks now. The hole in your room is a hole in you. You came and we let you in through the hole in you. You have always been here, the only child. A copy of a copy of a copy. Orange peel. The picture is you holding the picture. When you hear this you will know you’re in new you. You want to listen. You want to dream. You want to smile. You want to hurt. You don’t want to be. You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. Happiness

            <h2>The Nature of the Oldest House</h2>
            <img src="images/house.png">
            <p><u>ORIGIN</u></p>
            <p>
               Initial origin unknown. First discovered by the Bureau in 1964.
              </p>
              <p><u>NATURE & BEHAVIOR</u></p>
              <p>
                The Oldest House is a Place of Power possessing a deep and intrinsic connection to various alternate dimensions, particularly the Astral Plane. As a result, it exists outside of the ordinary laws of spacetime, and experiences constant shifts in its internal topography. The Oldest House is believed to be infinite in scale, with the area controlled by the FBC only representing an infinitesimal fraction of the Oldest House's true extent. From the outside, however, the Oldest House is a Brutalist skyscraper of defined and measurable size, meaning the building is larger on the inside than on the outside.</p>

                The Oldest House possesses a property which makes it imperceptible to anyone except those who are specifically looking for it. As a result, it remained undiscovered until the Bureau found it by accident during an AWE investigation in New York City in 1964. The Bureau itself later seemingly acquired this same property, making it difficult for the general populace to find. It is unknown when the Oldest House first appeared or was created, or whether its name has any bearing to its actual age.</p>
              </p>
              <p>There has been significant exploration of the Oldest House's nature. There is no certain answer, as the Foundation of the Oldest House has been deemed off-limits for several decades.</p>
              <p>For more details, see FBC1123480 (Yggdrassil) and FBC22349999-3 (Mapping Spatial Shifts—House Moods?).</p>
